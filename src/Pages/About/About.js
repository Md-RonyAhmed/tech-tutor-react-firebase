             My next goal is became a well established MERN stack developer. And
             I also learn AI and Python and Django as a backend.Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
             This is Md. Rony JavaScript || React || Node || Python I'm a
             self-motivated, honest, and hard-working person. I have some skills
             like C, C++, Python, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Redux,
             PHP, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Neural networks,
             Computer vision, Image processing, and Graphics design.

             So, I want to be a Full-stack web developer. My strong point is
             working long hours without losing patience. My weakness is whenever
             I get any task to do, I give so much time with it until it was
             finished and it kills some time. I participated in many programming
             contests on online and offline platforms Skills: JavaScript/ React/
             MongoDB/ HTML/ CSS/ Python/ Django/ Node/ Express/ Machine
             Learning/ Deep Learning/ Computer Vision / Image Processing
